        <p>Do these sound familiar? How many times have you heard them? Probably a lot. And you’ve probably heard them because when the staff encounters these obstacles, they don’t know where to turn for answers. But what if you had a well-crafted protocol to fall back on when problems arise?</p>

            <p>“Working with Amanda has been incredible! We purchased our practice three years ago - when we walked in, systems were lacking, and our patient management software was a complete mess. Amanda worked tirelessly with us to clean things up. We dug into the details together, and now our office runs much more smoothly. Amanda is crazy knowledgeable and we learn something new every time we interact! Amanda is one of the best in the business, we’ve absolutely loved working with her!” </p>
