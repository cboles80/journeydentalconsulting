            <p>Do these sound familiar? How many times have you heard them? Probably a lot. And you’ve probably heard
                them because when the staff encounters these obstacles, they don’t know where to turn for answers. But
                what if you had a well-crafted protocol to fall back on when problems&nbsp;arise?</p>
            <p class="dentrix-help center-text">The landscape of dentistry is evolving. Changes due to insurance,
                COVID-19, and staffing shortages have affected every office in one way or another. I believe that
                adapting our protocols and systems is the best way to run smoother. Ask me how I can help you
                and&nbsp;your&nbsp;office.

                <q>Amanda Boles has been outstanding in helping our new team understand Dentrix and dental office
                    teamwork. She led our team in learning terrific office skills, Dentrix day-to-day operations, and in
                    seeing the big picture. We are so appreciative of all Amanda has done for our team!</q>

                <q>Amanda more than a consultant to our office and I do not know what I would do without her. She uses
                    life coaching methods to get us to understand her "WHY"</q>

                <q>Working with Amanda has been incredible! We purchased our practice a few years ago - when we walked
                    in, systems were lacking, and our patient management software was a complete mess. Amanda worked
                    tirelessly with us to clean things up. We dug into the details together, and now our office runs
                    much more smoothly. Amanda is crazy knowledgeable and we learn something new every time we interact!
                    Amanda is one of the best in the business, we’ve absolutely loved working with her!</q>
